# GPASS
Global Position Addressing System for Services

## What is GPASS?
GPASS is an addressing system for identifying devices based on geographical location.

It supplies and receives data from said devices, and evaluates the services to provide to the device location.

## How is this different from GPS?
GPS is just one aspect that GPASS will cover.

GPS is used strictly for identifying and updating a device's location, based on its relative position to satellites.

GPASS will get the relative location, similar to GPS - however, it obtains the devices relative 'address' and notifies the nearest towers - Sending relay signals to the device to provide a service.

## How is the addressing system different from ip-addresses?
An ip-address is handled by the network and network provider... As such, the address is large, takes up more file space, harder to read, and changes constantly.

The GPASS addressing system has the first couplets be pre-set based on country, state, county, and relative towns based on the relay towers... The last sections of the addresses are based on relative street names - and position to the street names
